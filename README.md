# Design and Detection of Covert Man-in-the-Middle Cyberattacks on Water Treatment Plants

This repository supports the simulations and evaluations presented in our research paper on covert man-in-the-middle (MitM) attacks against industrial control systems, specifically targeting water treatment processes.

## ðŸ“„ Abstract

Cyberattacks targeting critical infrastructure â€” such as water treatment facilities â€” represent significant threats to public health, safety, and the environment. This paper introduces a systematic framework for modeling and assessing covert man-in-the-middle (MitM) attacks that leverage system identification techniques to inform the attack design. We focus on the attackerâ€™s ability to deploy a covert controller, and we evaluate countermeasures based on the state-of-the-art Process-Aware Stealthy Attack Detection (PASAD) anomaly detection method. Using a second-order linear time-invariant with time delay model, representative of water treatment dynamics, we design and simulate stealthy attacks. Our results highlight how factors such as system noise and inaccuracies in the attackerâ€™s plant model influence the attackâ€™s stealthiness, underscoring the need for more robust detection strategies in industrial control environments.

## ðŸš€ How to Use

1. **Set Parameters**  
   All system, attack, and detection parameters are defined in `params.m` and returned as a struct.

2. **Run Simulations**  
   Use one of the following scripts depending on your desired analysis:
   - `simulate_gamma.m`: vary only the attack magnitude (`gamma`)
   - `simulate_gamma_and_error.m`: vary both `gamma` and attacker model mismatch
   - `simulate_gamma_and_noise.m`: vary both `gamma` and system noise level

3. **View Results**  
   Visual outputs and confusion matrices are automatically generated using:
   - `plot_confusion_metrics.m`
   - `plot_heatmap.m`
   - `plot_max_detector.m`

4. **Reproduce Figures**  
   Saved `.mat` files (e.g., `results_model_error.mat`) contain all raw results and can be reloaded for plotting and analysis.
